Q&A

1. What is a black box model?
A black box model refers to a system or a process where the internal workings or mechanisms are hidden from the user or observer. In other words, the inputs and outputs of the system are known, but the inner workings, logic, or algorithms that produce those outputs from given inputs are not transparent or easily understandable.
